                <p> Welcome to my final project page. Me and my partner Cody decided to make a game where the player moves up and down and collects stars while avoiding aliens. We ended up deciciding to have two stages and having the health and enemy system come in to play in the second stage. This allows the player to get used to the controls before they get to the difficult stage. The hit detection system makes it so you have to grab the stars with your hand but aliens can hit you anywhere so we had to completely change the hitboxes depending on whst was being hit. The user beats the game when they collect 25 stars where they are then shown the end screen and gives them a score based off of how many hearts they had left.
