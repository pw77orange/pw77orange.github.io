        Welcome to <em>Payton's</em> Programming Portfolio <br>
        My name is Payton Wallace. This website will act as my CSC106 Programming Portfolio where I will put the projects I code for this class. I wrote the code for this website in the HTML language. The about me button will take you to a seperate page that has more information about me. The javascripts button will take you to a seperate page with the projects I make that are coded in the java language.<br>
